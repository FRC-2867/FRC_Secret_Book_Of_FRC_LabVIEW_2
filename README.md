# FRC_Secret_Book_Of_FRC_LabVIEW-2 - FRC LabVIEW and Control Theory training

This material is an UNOFFICIAL set of training materials for the FRC robotics competition.  It focuses on the use of LabVIEW to program robots.  There is also a separate section containing some control theory training.  This training can be used with any programming language.

I am not the originator of the Secret Book of FRC LabVIEW.  That individual is no longer involved with a First FRC team.  This update adds additional information and revises the book for the latest control system hardware.  See the book's introduction for additional information.

## Reporting Issues

Use the github issues menu to submit information on issues and suggested enhancements.  
I'll attempt to deal with issues in a reasonable time, but there are no guarantees.

When submitting an issue, please follow these guidelines:
- Make certain you are using the latest version of the repository.  If not, install the latest version and see if the issue still occurs.
- See if the issue has already been reported.  If so, add any new details to the existing issue.
- Write a very detailed specific description of the problem.
- Include any screen shots or other data needed to show the issue.
- Describe exactly how to reproduce the error.  (Likely, I can't try this on your robot...)
- If possible, try and condense the problem to a small test program that isolates the issue.
- If you found a work around, please include it for others to use.
See ![Contributing.md!](Contributing.md) for additional details.

## Contributing

Contributions of enhancements, bug fixes, and new routines are welcome.  If new routines are not already part of the C++/Java WPILIB, then it seems fair that they 
should be written solely by FRC student members, with confirmation from a mentor on their team to be able to be candidates for inclusion.  
See ![Contributing.md!](Contributing.md) for additional details.
